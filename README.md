Task:
Given two sentences of text, s1 and s2, the systems need to compute
how similar s1 and s2 are, returning a similarity score between 0 and
5. The dataset comprises naturally occurring pairs of sentences drawn
from several domains and genres, annotated by crowdsourcing. See
papers by Agirre et al. (2012; 2013; 2014; 2015; 2016; 2017).
